          <li>The ShipBob &ldquo;Services&rdquo; include:<br>
            (a) providing technology solutions to support the receipt, counting, storage, picking and packaging (&ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo;) of physical goods sold by you (the &ldquo;Goods&rdquo;) pursuant to your order (&ldquo;Order&rdquo;) by ShipBob or by independent third-party warehouses using the ShipBob&rsquo;s proprietary Warehouse Management System (&ldquo;WMS&rdquo;) and referred to as ShipBob Fulfillment Network Providers (&ldquo;SFN Providers&rdquo;);<br>
            (b) providing technology solutions to support the shipment of the Goods by independent third-party carriers (each, a &ldquo;Carrier&rdquo;);<br>
            (c) access to ShipBob&rsquo;s proprietary platform and associated technology, in object code format only, which is made available by ShipBob to you, for purposes of managing Goods, submitting Orders for Goods and fulfilling Orders (the &ldquo;ShipBob Platform&rdquo;); and<br>
            (d) all data, reports, text, images, sounds, video, and content, including any offline reports, pricing matrices, or other content, made available to you through any of the foregoing (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Content&rdquo;), including, in each case, all modifications and updates.</li>
          <li>We may separately enter into a Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement (&ldquo;Fulfillment Agreement&rdquo;) with you, which may modify the terms of the Services. If we do so, the terms of the Fulfillment Agreement shall take precedence over any conflicting terms of this Agreement. The terms of any Fulfillment Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. In our sole discretion, we also may provide you additional Services as set forth in the Excel and Bulk Upload and Promotional/Volume Spikes Agreement (&ldquo;Volume Agreement&rdquo;). If we do provide these additional Services, the terms of the Volume Agreement shall be incorporated into this Agreement. The terms of the Volume Agreement shall take precedence over any conflicting terms in this Agreement.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>SFN Providers&rsquo; Responsibilities.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>You understand and agree that ShipBob provides a technology platform connecting you with SFN Providers who are responsible for warehousing, picking and packing, and fulfilling your Goods. The Services offered by ShipBob pursuant to this Agreement do not include any of these services when your Goods are serviced by an SFN Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShipBob may also provide warehouse, pick or pack, or fulfillment services for you, in which case this Agreement will govern ShipBob as a technology platform provider and as a performing SFN Provider.</li>
          <li>ShipBob will help facilitate the filing of claims with SFN Providers for Goods that are lost or damaged by an SFN Provider, but ShipBob is not responsible for any shrinkage, loss, or damage caused by an SFN Provider. All such claims shall be subject to ShipBob&rsquo;s Operations Errors Policy.</li>
          <li>When such warehouse, pick or pack, and fulfillment services are performed by an SFN Provider, ShipBob will use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the SFN Provider&rsquo;s assent to the following terms: (a) SFN Provider must utilize ShipBob&rsquo;s proprietary Warehouse Management System and follow ShipBob&rsquo;s fulfillment policies; (b) that the SFN Provider has the necessary approvals, authorities, licenses, and insurance to provide the fulfillment services; (c) that the SFN Provider will comply with all federal, state, provincial, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances including, but not limited to, safety-related laws and regulations; (d) that the SFN Provider accepts the duty of care consistent with all applicable industry best management practices, industry guidelines, and the care a reasonably careful person would exercise under like circumstances and (d) that the SFN Provider will maintain insurance as required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShipBob does not guarantee the suitability, legality, or ability of any SFN Provider. You agree that ShipBob is not responsible or liable for the SFN Providers&rsquo; performance of the warehousing, pick and pack, or fulfillment services and that ShipBob does not guarantee any SFN Provider&rsquo;s compliance with applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Carriers&rsquo; Responsibilities.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>You understand and agree that ShipBob provides a technology platform connecting you with Carriers who are responsible for the actual shipping of your Goods. ShipBob shall use its proprietary technology to find the best available shipping option with a Carrier based upon the dimensions, desired speed, and final destination of the Order. ShipBob is not a carrier and does not itself ship or arrange to ship your Goods, nor do the Services include any shipping services.</li>
          <li>ShipBob will help facilitate the filing of claims with Carriers for Goods that are lost or damaged by a Carrier, but ShipBob is not responsible for any loss or damage caused by a Carrier. All such claims shall be subject to ShipBob&rsquo;s Lost in Transit and Damage Claims Policy.</li>
          <li>ShipBob will use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the Carrier&rsquo;s assent to the following terms: (a) that the Carrier has the necessary approvals, authorities, licenses, and insurance to provide the shipping services; (b) that the Carrier will comply with all federal, state, provincial, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances including, but not limited to, safety laws and regulations and (c) that the Carrier will maintain insurance as required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ShipBob will not assess or guarantee the suitability, legality, or ability of any Carrier. You agree that ShipBob is not responsible or liable for the Carriers&rsquo; performance of the shipping services and that ShipBob does not guarantee any Carriers&rsquo; compliance with applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>

The License may be terminated immediately at ShipBob&rsquo;s sole discretion and shall, in any event, terminate upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</li>
          <li>You are solely responsible for all data, information, feedback, suggestions, text, content, and other materials that you upload, post, deliver, provide, or otherwise transmit or store in connection with or relating to the Services (&ldquo;Your Content&rdquo;).

          <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password, Your Content, account, and for all activities that occur under your login or account.

          <li>You understand that the operation of the Services, including Your Content, may be unencrypted and may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices; and (iii) transmission to ShipBob&rsquo;s third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Services. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection, and backup of Your Content. ShipBob will have no liability to you for any unauthorized access or use of any of Your Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction, or loss of any of Your Content, and you will indemnify and hold ShipBob harmless for any claims, damages, or liability related to Your Content.</li>
          <li>You own all of Your Content or have obtained all permissions, releases, rights, or licenses required to engage in your posting and other activities (and to allow ShipBob to perform its obligations) in connection with the Services without obtaining any further releases or consents. Your Content does not, and will not, violate, infringe, or misappropriate any third party&rsquo;s intellectual property or privacy rights, nor does Your Content contain any matter that is defamatory, obscene, unlawful, threatening, abusive, tortious, offensive, or harassing</li>
          <li>You shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services, including hardware, software, networks, and telephone service (collectively, &ldquo;Your Equipment&rdquo;). Your Equipment must comply with all specifications set forth in ShipBob&rsquo;s policies then in effect. You shall also be responsible for maintaining the security of Your Equipment, your Account, passwords (including but not limited to administrative and user passwords), files, and for all uses of your Account or Your Equipment with or without your knowledge or consent.</li>
          <li>You have no right to access ShipBob&rsquo;s physical facilities or property or any of the SFN Provider&rsquo;s physical facilities or property. Under no circumstances, and at no time, during the Term of this Agreement or after, are you permitted to enter ShipBob&rsquo;s or the SFN Providers&rsquo; facilities, fulfillment centers, or premises without prior express written notice by ShipBob or the SFN Provider. As your Goods may be commingled with the Goods of other merchants in ShipBob&rsquo;s or SFN Providers&rsquo; facilities, under no circumstances, during the Term or after, may you access the Goods while the Goods are stored in ShipBob&rsquo;s or SFN Providers&rsquo; facilities, without prior express written consent of ShipBob and the SFN Provider. If you are granted access, you will be monitored during the access period and your access can be terminated at ShipBob&rsquo;s or the SFN Provider&rsquo;s discretion.</li>
          <li>ShipBob reserves the right to use your name and/or company name as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on ShipBob&rsquo;s Site and in other communication with existing or potential Merchants. To decline ShipBob this right you need to email support@shipbob.com stating that you do not wish to be used as a reference.</li>
          <li>ShipBob may provide, at ShipBob&rsquo;s sole discretion, technical support services, through email, chat, or telephone in accordance with our standard practice.</li>
          <li>ShipBob is not the Merchant of Record for any of your Goods or the importer of record for Goods stored at an SFN Provider. ShipBob shall not be held liable for complying with your instructions through the Services. You understand that ShipBob does not inspect your Goods nor does ShipBob take responsibility for the business decisions that you make and implement through the Services. For example, ShipBob cannot control or ensure that a buyer or seller with whom you do business will remit payment for Goods in accordance with your agreement with them.</li>
        </ol>

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Service Fees.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>&ldquo;Service Fees&rdquo; are the fees for any Services and any third-party fees (third-party fees include, but are not limited to, Carrier, SFN Provider, and other shipping fees, rates of duty, international brokerage charges, freight charges, insurance premiums, or other third-party charges incurred during your use of the Service).</li>
          <li>You shall pay the following Service Fees (unless modified by a Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement, your Pricing Quotation uploaded through the ShipBob Platform, or Volume Agreement):
            <ol>
              <li>A $25.00 initial receiving fee to inventory and store the Goods, but if receipt of the Goods takes more than two (2) hours, then you shall pay $40.00 per additional hour for the remainder of the time required to inventory and store the Goods;</li>
              <li>A $40.00 monthly pallet fee, $10 monthly shelf fee, or a $5.00 monthly bin fee, whichever is applicable per SKU, that shall be due for any whole or partial month, beginning on the date that inventory is delivered to ShipBob. An Unidentified Receiving Order (&ldquo;URO&rdquo;) is subject to additional fees pursuant to our On-Hold Receiving (URO) Policy;</li>
              <li>Fulfillment charges, which shall be calculated based on the final destination, dimensions of the final packaged shipment, and speed of shipment selected;</li>
              <li>Above four (4) picks per order will be billed at an additional $0.20 per pick;</li>
              <li>Charges, costs, taxes, and expenses identified in Section 8.5 and 8.6; and</li>
              <li>Any charges or fees incurred by ShipBob associated with your payment for the Services by credit card.<br>
                In the event of conflict between the Services Fees in these Terms, the Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement, Pricing Quotation, or Volume Agreement, the following order of priority shall apply: the Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement, the Pricing Quotation, the Volume Agreement, followed by these Terms.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Quotations accepted through the ShipBob Platform are estimates based on the best information available at the time made. The final rates and Service Fees may vary based upon the Goods actually tendered, the work actually performed, or a number of factors such as Carrier shipping prices, the actual characteristics of your Goods, the delivery address, and service requested during the normal course of delivery. ShipBob reserves the right to bill the Service Fees based on actual charges at any time after the Services are rendered. ShipBob specifically disclaims liability for any Carrier shipping rate errors due to inaccurate or incomplete information provided to it, such as dimensions and weights.</li>
          <li>All dollar amounts stated in this Agreement and the Site will be in US dollars, unless otherwise specified.</li>
          <li>You acknowledge that you are responsible for, and agree to reimburse ShipBob, SFN Providers, and Carriers, as applicable, for, all sales taxes, transportation taxes, Service Fees, reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by ShipBob, SFN Providers, and Carriers, as applicable in connection with the Services. Carrier chargebacks are subject to additional administrative fees as specified in our Policies.</li>
          <li>You acknowledge and agree that all Service Fees, charges, and any other rates or amounts charged by ShipBob to you hereunder are exclusive of applicable value added, sales/use or inventory, CDT (as defined below) and service taxes (&ldquo;Transaction Taxes&rdquo;) which may be levied in connection with the supply by ShipBob of the Services to you. Where applicable, you shall pay all Transaction Taxes arising in respect of the Service Fees or other amounts charged to you by ShipBob.</li>
          <li><strong>International CDT</strong>. Customs, Duties, and Taxes (&ldquo;CDT&rdquo;) on any international shipment charged by the Carrier are your sole responsibility and will be charged back to you regardless of whether they were or were not in the initial estimate, or whether the order was or was not delivered.</li>
          <li><strong>Failure to Pay; Abandoned Account; Liquidation.</strong> Failure to promptly pay Service Fees is a material breach of this Agreement. If your Service Fees (or any other amounts owed to ShipBob, SFN Providers, or Carriers) remain unpaid for a period greater than thirty (30) days, then ShipBob reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement, suspend its performance of Services, and/or reclassify your Account as an &ldquo;Abandoned Account.&rdquo; Additionally, any Account that remains unpaid for greater than sixty (60) days will automatically be deemed an Abandoned Account. <strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UPON AN ACCOUNT BECOMING AN ABANDONED ACCOUNT, ALL RIGHTS TO OWNERSHIP OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE AND GOODS WILL IMMEDIATELY BE FORFEITED BY YOU TO SHIPBOB. GOODS WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY AND IRREVOCABLY UNAVAILABLE TO YOU, AND LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS WILL BEGIN</strong>. You agree such Goods would be free and clear of liability, and that you would assume any liability therefore. You will remain liable for any pending Service Fees above and beyond the liquidation proceeds.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Payment Method and Liens.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Payment processing for Services is provided by Stripe and is subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the &ldquo;Stripe Service Agreement&rdquo;) set forth at. By agreeing to this Agreement or continuing to utilize our Services as a Merchant, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Service Agreement, as modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of ShipBob enabling payment processing through Stripe, you agree to provide ShipBob accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize ShipBob to share it and transaction information (including User Data) related to your use of payment processing provided by Stripe.</li>
          <li>Unless otherwise specified by ShipBob, Stripe will collect payment from you via credit card or ACH for Service Fees due on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis depending on the account set-up. ShipBob disclaims all liability for any fees charged to you by your bank related to Stripe&rsquo;s collection or disbursement of such payment.</li>
          <li>When you use the Services, all charges for the Services and any additional fees payable to ShipBob will be immediately charged to the credit card associated with your Stripe account. You agree to pay ShipBob the amount that is specified in accordance with this Agreement. If you dispute any charges, you must let ShipBob know within thirty (30) days after the date that ShipBob invoices you.</li>
          <li>You agree and acknowledge that either ShipBob or the SFN Provider, depending on which party is performing the warehouse, pick and pick, or fulfillment services shall maintain an actual or constructive general and continuing warehouseman&rsquo;s lien and security interest under the UCC for all Goods in ShipBob&rsquo;s or SFN Provider&rsquo;s possession or control, regardless of whether a specific receipt is issued, to cover all charges, expenses, costs, and Service Fees set forth in this Agreement. In the event ShipBob or an SFN Provider is required to exercise its lien or security interest, you shall be responsible for all necessary and reasonable costs incurred to enforce the lien or security interest including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. You will execute any and all agreements and documents so that ShipBob or an SFN Provider may obtain, perfect, and maintain its lien rights and security interest in the Goods. You will also execute any and all documentation to permit ShipBob to perfect the liens.</li>

          <li>You represent and warrant to ShipBob that (i) you are the legal owner of the Goods and/or have lawful possession or control of the Goods and that you have the sole legal right to store and thereafter direct the release and/or delivery of the Goods, (ii) there are no potential health, safety, or environmental hazards associated with the shipment, warehousing, or fulfillment of the Goods tendered to ShipBob under this Agreement, (iii) the Goods do not contain any material violating any federal, state, or local law (collectively, &ldquo;Laws&rdquo;); (iv) the Goods are not and do not contain any hazardous or dangerous materials under applicable Laws and are in compliance with ShipBob&rsquo;s Dangerous Goods / HAZMAT Policy; and (v) the Goods do not violate ShipBob&rsquo;s Acceptable Products Policy. You will strictly meet or exceed any compliance obligations under these provisions. ShipBob may, in its sole discretion, reject Goods that ShipBob determines do not meet the above compliance obligations. If the Goods do not meet the foregoing requirements, you may incur additional fees from ShipBob, and if ShipBob rejects the Goods, this may result in a delay or non-shipment, and you agree that ShipBob shall not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of such delay or non-shipment.</li>
          <li>You shall provide ShipBob, in a digital format through the ShipBob dashboard, with bills of lading for the inventory of all inbound shipments of Goods prior to the shipment arriving to an SFN Provider&rsquo;s facility. All inbound shipments shall be properly labeled and clearly identify the units and quantities of carton, case, or master case. You represent and warrant that the information set forth on any shipment or delivery document, including, without limitation, information as to count, weight, description and condition of the Goods, is accurate and complete and may be relied upon by ShipBob.If the items in such a shipment cannot be identified by ShipBob, they may be discarded and ShipBob assumes no responsibility for any associated losses. If the quantity of any SKU (or any SKU in a box or pallet) received at an SFN Provider&rsquo;s facility is either ten percent (10%) greater, or more than twenty-five (25) units more, than the expected quantity you submitted in the WRO, you will be required to submit a new accurate WRO. The warehouse receiving order shall be attached to the side of the box and the product name shall be clearly and conspicuously written on the outside of box.</li>
          <li>You need to make an appointment in advance for any inbound freight shipment (non-parcel).</li>

        <h3>Onboarding.</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>All inbound shipments must be received and inventoried before the Goods shall be prepared to be shipped by the Carriers.</li>
              <li>Upon receipt, ShipBob or SFN Provider may, at its sole discretion, verify the quantity of the Goods and inspect for any damage. You acknowledge and agree that ShipBob or SFN Provider has no obligation to verify the quantity, content, condition, or quality of the Goods delivered to SFN Provider&rsquo;s facility for storage and/or delivery. ShipBob or SFN Provider may, at its sole discretion, reject storing and/or delivering any Goods that ShipBob or SFN Provider deems, in its sole discretion, to be improperly labeled or packaged as a URO, or any Goods that contain any hazardous or illegal material.</li>
              <li>If there are any outstanding or pending Orders that need to be fulfilled first, you shall notify ShipBob of the number of Orders to be sent initially and the expected timeline of processing such Orders.</li>
              <li>Unless otherwise specified in a Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement or Volume Agreement, upon actual receipt of the Goods, you can expect a minimum of three (3) business days for Goods to be inventoried at ShipBob or an SFN Provider&rsquo;s facility. After three (3) business days, your Orders will begin to be processed and labeled, beginning with outstanding and pending Orders. These timelines are subject to change during Peak Season (as defined below) or other holiday days.</li>
              <li>ShipBob will facilitate fulfillment of the number of Orders which was communicated during onboarding every day. Additional time may be required for special kitting, picking or any alterations in regular process.</li>
              <li>ShipBob or SFN Providers, as applicable, shall thereafter process, package, and facilitate the shipment of all Orders by Carriers within one (1) business day of actual receipt of the Order from you provided that proper inventory amounts exist and there are no issues with the Order. This provision shall not apply to Orders that are altered, Orders with low inventory items (less than ten (10) items in stock), held Orders and bulk Orders.</li>
              <li>You shall provide ShipBob with an expectation of the date for ShipBob or the SFN Provider to begin facilitating Carriers to ship your Goods, which shall conform to the terms of this Agreement.</li>

        </ol>
     
        <ol>
          <li>You shall be solely responsible for the accuracy of any information provided to ShipBob and/or inputted onto ShipBob&rsquo;s Site or Platform .

          <li><strong>Volume Agreement for Excel and Bulk Uploads and Promotional/Volume Spikes</strong>. Other than the obligations set forth below, ShipBob bears no other liability or obligations for Excel and Bulk Uploads or Promotional / Volume Spikes. The Volume Agreement, as provided in this Section, shall apply to any Excel Upload orders or large spikes in volume above regular volume. For Orders subject to this Volume Agreement, Merchant will provide notice via the Promotional/Bulk Upload Details Google Form (&ldquo;Google Form&rdquo;). All Google Forms must be true and accurate.<br>
            Merchants with inconsistent volume with frequent and infrequent spikes without prior notice to ShipBob create difficulty in predicting the labor required. Infrequent high volume makes it difficult for ShipBob to predict and plan labor and other resources. Accordingly, the following terms apply:

              <li>ShipBob will facilitate the increase of labor on hand to fulfill large Order drops on the same day. In the event these large Order drops do not occur, ShipBob will charge a fee to help recoup the costs of unnecessary additional labor. Merchant may cancel a stated large order drop at no fee if they provide forty-eight (48) hour written notice.</li>
              <li>The following additional charges for Services shall apply to Excel and Bulk Uploads and Promotional/Volume Spikes:
                <ol>
                  <li>If at least 50% of stated order volume is placed, no charge and (2) if under 50% of stated Order volume is placed, a charge of $1.25 per Order for all Orders from the stated volume to the realized volume will be assessed to recoup labor costs. (For example, if you stated you would place 200 Orders and only placed 50 Orders, you would be assessed a fee of $187.50, with 150 Orders at $1.25 per Order).</li>
                </ol>

        <h3>Shippable Addresses.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You are solely responsible for the accuracy and deliverability of Order shipping addresses. ShipBob may, at its sole discretion, verify Order shipping addresses, but this is not a replacement for merchant address diligence and verification by you. You agree and acknowledge that ShipBob has no obligation to verify any shipping addresses provided by you.</li>
          <li>If ShipBob provides an Order shipping estimate based on an address later discovered to be inaccurate or incomplete, you are solely responsible for any applicable address correction fees ShipBob incurs from the Carrier, any difference in Carrier shipping cost or for any other costs or fees due to the incomplete or inaccurate address. Examples of discrepancies for which you may be responsible include, but are not limited to, incomplete addresses, incorrect addresses, commercial/residential address status, and rural address status. ShipBob also reserves the right to put the order on hold if addresses are not validated by the ShipBob system.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Service Level Agreement</h3>
        <p>ShipBob and SFN Provider SLAs are subject to increase during &ldquo;Peak Season&rdquo; (defined as the dates between and including Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve, but subject to change dependent upon Carriers) by email notification.

          <li><strong>ShipBob Is Not Liable for International Returns</strong>. International shipments that are not delivered are often returned by the Carrier and assessed return shipping, brokerage, and returns processing Carrier fees. These fees assessed by the Carriers are billed through to merchants, often without notice. ShipBob strives to work with you to circumvent international returns or abandoned inventory at your request; however, this is done only on a reasonable efforts basis and ShipBob reserves the right to charge you fees to the value of the original Carrier shipping cost, including all costs and expenses of returns. If a tariff is not available, ShipBob will either put orders on hold until tariff information is available or override the order with no liability to ShipBob.</li>

You shall not have any obligation, however, to preserve the confidentiality of any such materials and information to the limited extent that it: (a) is in the public domain or generally available to the public; (b) was in the possession of or disclosed to you prior to the date hereof, free of any obligation to keep the same confidential; (c) is lawfully acquired by you from a third party under no obligation of confidentiality to the other Party; or (d) is required to be disclosed by you under law or court order, provided, however, that you shall give prompt written notice thereof to ShipBob (where permitted by law).

        <ol>
          <li>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN SFN PROVIDERS AND CARRIERS ARE IN POSSESSION OF YOUR GOODS, SFN PROVIDERS AND CARRIERS, AND NOT SHIPBOB, ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED HARMS SUSTAINED BY YOU OR YOUR GOODS AS DETERMINED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</li>

FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, SHIPBOB IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF THE GOODS DAMAGE CAP OR THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY CAP SET FORTH BELOW, WHICHEVER IS THE LESSER AMOUNT.</li>
          <li>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

              <li>FOR GREATER COVERAGE, YOU MUST ADD INSURANCE IN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE GOODS THAT YOU WISH TO BE COVERED BY INSURANCE, IN WHICH CASE AN INCREASED CHARGE WILL BE MADE BASED UPON SUCH INCREASED COVERAGE.

        <h3>Miscellaneous.</h3>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect, and enforceable. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, representations, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement (or a Volume Agreement or Warehousing and Fulfillment Pricing Agreement), the terms of this Agreement shall take precedence over any contrary or conflicting terms in any other agreement. The failure of ShipBob to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of that right. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and ShipBob, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and ShipBob, and it governs your use of the Services. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind ShipBob in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement or otherwise, the substantially prevailing party will be entitled to recover its costs, expenses and attorneys&rsquo; fees. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.</p>

        <h3><strong>B2B Orders:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>For orders being shipped to a business (&ldquo;B2B Order&rdquo;), ShipBob allows the use of pre-paid labels or merchant-directed freight shipments. When submitting a B2B order for facilitation through ShipBob, the following conditions apply:
                <ol>
                  <li aria-level="4">ShipBob will notify you via email once a pre-paid parcel or Merchant-arranged freight order has been packed.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">After this notification, you will have five (5) business days to upload a shipping label for pre-paid parcel shipments or to have a freight provider pick up your Merchant-arranged freight order.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">After five (5) business days if the conditions in step 2 have not been met, you will be assessed a $25.00 fee per day for pre-paid parcel orders or a $50.00 fee per day for Merchant arranged freight orders.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">After five (5) business days from the time an order was packed, if you have not yet uploaded shipping labels for your parcel order or have not yet had a Carrier pick up your Merchant-arranged freight order, ShipBob will facilitate the restocking of your B2B order and you will be assessed a cancellation fee. This cancellation fee will be equal to the SFN Provider&rsquo;s total cost to prepare the order, including, but not limited to, pick fees, prepaid label fees, and any other costs incurred to prepare the order.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">If you cancel a B2B order after the SFN Provider has started to pick your B2B order, you will also incur the above cancellation fee in addition to the original fee to prepare your B2B order.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">ShipBob reserves the right to charge for a prepaid order once it has been packed.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">If the SFN Provider does not pack a B2B order within ShipBob&rsquo;s stated SLA, ShipBob will cover all costs if you provide proof of invoice for you having to reschedule freight, up to a maximum of $500.00. In this circumstance, ShipBob will not assess a late fee and also will arrange for the SFN Provider to hold the order for up to fifteen (15) business days before restocking, and restocking will be done free of cost. If the SFN Provider fails to pack an order within ShipBob&rsquo;s stated SLA, and you contact ShipBob to request a hold, ShipBob will arrange for the SFN Provider to hold the packed B2B order for up to thirty (30) calendar days.</li>
                  <li aria-level="4">ShipBob, SFN Providers and Carriers shall not be responsible for any chargebacks, penalties, fines, or liquidated damages of any kind, including those from your customers.</li>
